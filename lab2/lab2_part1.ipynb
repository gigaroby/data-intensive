Let's derive an RDD, named `enPages`, containing only English pages from pagecounts. This can be done by applying a `filter()` function to pagecounts. For each record, we can split it by the field delimiter (i.e., a space) and get the second field, and then compare it with the string \"en\". To avoid reading from disks each time we perform any operations on the RDD, we can use `cache()` to cache the RDD into memory. "

Next time any action is invoked on `enPages`, Spark will cache the data set in memory across the workers in your cluster. So, let's count the number of records, which are there for English pages. The first time this command is run, it will take 2-3 minutes while Spark scans through the entire data set on disk. But since `enPages` was marked as \"cached\" in the previous step, if you run count on the same RDD again, it should return an order of magnitude faster."

By default, Spark assumes that the reduce function is commutative and associative and applies combiners on the mapper side. Since we know there is a very limited number of keys in this case (because there are only 3 unique dates in our data set), letâ€™s use only one reducer."

But, given the large number of pages (23 million distinct page names), the new task is very expensive. We are doing an expensive group-by with a lot of network shuffling of data. To recap, first we split each line of data into its respective fields. Next, we extract the fields for page name and number of page views. We reduce by key again, this time with 40 reducers. Then we filter out pages with less than 200,000 total views over our time window represented by our dataset."
